The OWASP Cebu City Chapter is a local community dedicated to web application security in Cebu City, Philippines. As part of the global Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation, this chapter brings together cybersecurity professionals, developers, educators, and enthusiasts to share knowledge and promote better security practices.


## Welcome to OWASP Cebu City

Welcome to the OWASP Cebu City Chapter! We are a dynamic community of cybersecurity professionals, developers, students, and enthusiasts dedicated to improving web application security in Cebu City and throughout the Philippines.

Our chapter focuses on knowledge-sharing, skills development, and building a strong network of security-minded individuals in the region. We organize regular meetups, workshops, and training sessions that address both fundamental and advanced security concepts.

Whether you're a seasoned security professional or just beginning your journey in application security, OWASP Cebu City provides a welcoming environment to learn, contribute, and connect with like-minded individuals.

Join us at our next event to be part of the growing cybersecurity community in Cebu!
